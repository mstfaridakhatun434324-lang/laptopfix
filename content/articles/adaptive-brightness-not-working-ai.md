faqs:
  - q: "Will resetting the app delete my files?"
    a: >
      No. Repairing or resetting an app removes its settings and cache, not your documents, photos, or personal files. A Windows reset with the keep-my-files option also preserves personal files, but you should still back up first.
  - q: "When should I contact support about adaptive brightness not working ai laptop fix?"
    a: >
      If every fix in this guide fails, the hardware is not detected in Device Manager, or the problem appeared right after physical damage or a liquid spill, contact your laptop maker's support team. Note the exact symptoms and the steps you already tried.
  - q: "Can adaptive brightness not working ai laptop fix be caused by a Windows update?"
    a: >
      Yes. Feature updates can reset permissions, replace drivers, or introduce temporary incompatibilities. Installing the latest cumulative update and the newest drivers from your laptop maker usually resolves update-related cases.
  - q: "Why did adaptive brightness not working ai laptop fix start suddenly?"
    a: >
      Most often a Windows update, a driver update, or a settings change is responsible. Check what changed on the laptop in the last few days, then work through the driver and settings fixes in this guide before assuming a hardware fault.

If you are dealing with adaptive brightness not working ai laptop fix, you are not alone. AI features on Windows 11 depend on several layers working together — the NPU, the graphics driver, Windows services, and the app itself — so a fault in any one layer shows up as the same symptom. A related problem, [Click To Do Gesture Not Working](/articles/click-to-do-gesture-not-working/), often shares the same root cause.

The good news is that the fix is usually straightforward once you find the right layer. In most cases the problem comes down to a driver that needs updating, a service that has stopped, or a setting that changed after a Windows update. Readers fixing [Windows Ml Npu Not Working](/articles/windows-ml-npu-not-working/) frequently find the same driver or settings fix helps here too.

Below you will find the most common causes first, followed by a set of fixes in the order you should try them. Each fix is self-contained, so you can stop as soon as the feature starts working again.

## Why this happens

- **Hardware detection failure:** If Windows stops detecting the NPU or a sensor after a BIOS or driver change, every feature built on that hardware fails at the same time.

- **Insufficient system resources:** Low free disk space or memory pressure can prevent AI models from loading. The feature may open but never finish, or close without an error.

- **A pending restart or update:** Some fixes only take effect after a restart, and a half-installed update can leave components in an inconsistent state until the machine reboots.

- **Outdated or mismatched drivers:** The NPU, graphics, and chipset drivers must work as a set. When one is updated and the others are not, AI workloads can fail or fall back to slower hardware.

- **A Windows update changed a setting:** Feature updates sometimes reset privacy, camera, microphone, or optional-feature settings. The feature may be healthy but blocked by a permission it no longer has.

- **A stopped or disabled Windows service:** AI features rely on background services for indexing, search, and device management. If a service fails to start, the feature that depends on it stalls.

## How to fix it

Work through these in order — diagnose first, then act.

### Fix 1: Check the feature in Settings

Start with the least invasive checks so you do not waste time reinstalling things that were never broken. A quick look at the obvious places often reveals the cause in under five minutes.

1. Open Settings and confirm the feature is switched on and has the permissions it needs.

2. Check that your Microsoft account is signed in, if the feature requires one.

3. Look for any warning or error banner at the top of the relevant Settings page.

4. Restart the laptop once, then test the feature again before moving on.

5. Note exactly what happens — nothing at all, an error message, or partial behaviour — for later steps.

### Fix 2: Update the NPU, chipset, and graphics drivers

Drivers are the single most common fix for AI laptop problems, because the NPU and its supporting hardware change quickly. Installing the correct, current driver restores the link between Windows and the hardware.

For official driver and troubleshooting steps, see [Microsoft Windows support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) and [Windows 11 download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).

1. Open Device Manager and expand System devices, looking for the NPU or AI accelerator entry.

2. Right-click the entry, choose Update driver, and let Windows search automatically first.

3. If Windows finds nothing new, download the latest driver from your laptop maker's support site.

4. Install the chipset and graphics drivers from the same source, then restart the laptop.

5. Test the feature again and check Device Manager for any remaining warning icons.

### Fix 3: Repair Windows components and install pending updates

Windows itself can be the problem, especially after a feature update. Missing optional components or a corrupted system file can quietly break AI features while everything else looks normal.

1. Open Settings, then Windows Update, and install every pending update.

2. Restart the laptop, even if Windows does not ask you to, and test again.

3. Open Terminal as administrator and run the System File Checker scan to repair damaged files.

4. If the scan reports problems it cannot fix, run the DISM restore-health command and reboot.

5. Re-test the feature after each stage so you know which step actually fixed it.

### Fix 4: Reset or reinstall the affected app

Apps that host AI features sometimes need a reset of their own. Clearing a corrupted cache or reinstalling the app package restores default behaviour without touching your documents.

1. Open Settings, then Apps, then Installed apps, and find the app involved.

2. Open Advanced options and choose Repair first, then test the feature.

3. If repair does not help, choose Reset in the same place and test again.

4. For a system app, use PowerShell as administrator to re-register the app package.

5. Restart the laptop after reinstalling and confirm the feature works before restoring custom settings.

### Fix 5: Check privacy, permission, and account settings

Privacy and permission settings are a frequent hidden cause. Camera, microphone, and diagnostic-data permissions gate many AI features, and a single denied permission can disable the whole feature.

1. Open Settings, then Privacy and security, and review camera and microphone permissions.

2. Confirm the app has permission and that the system-wide toggle is on.

3. Check that diagnostic data and optional experiences are not blocked by a policy.

4. If you use a work or school account, test with a personal account to rule out policy blocks.

5. Re-enable anything you changed deliberately only after confirming the feature works.

### Fix 6: Adjust power and performance settings

Power management can silently starve AI hardware. Battery saver, USB selective suspend, and sleep settings can switch off the components a feature needs, particularly on laptops running on battery.

1. Plug the laptop into AC power and switch to the Best performance power mode.

2. Open Device Manager, find the relevant device, and clear any allow-the-computer-to-turn-off option.

3. Disable battery saver temporarily and test the feature again.

4. Check your laptop maker's power utility for an AI or performance profile and enable it.

5. If the feature works on AC power but not on battery, keep the power settings you just changed.

## Closing

Most cases of adaptive brightness not working ai laptop fix come down to a driver, a permission, or a service that needs attention rather than a hardware failure. Work through the fixes above in order, test after each one, and keep the change that restores the feature. If you need a related walkthrough, see [Microsoft 365 Copilot Vs Windows Copilot](/articles/microsoft-365-copilot-vs-windows-copilot/) for another AI laptop fix, and revisit the driver and update steps after the next Windows feature update to keep the feature stable.
